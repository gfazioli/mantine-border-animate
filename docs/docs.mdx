import { InstallScript } from './components/InstallScript/InstallScript';
import * as demos from './demos';

## Installation

<InstallScript packages="@gfazioli/mantine-border-animate" />

After installation import package styles at the root of your application:

```tsx
import '@gfazioli/mantine-border-animate/styles.css';
```

You can import styles within a layer `@layer mantine-border-animate` by importing `@gfazioli/mantine-border-animate/styles.layer.css` file.

```tsx
import '@gfazioli/mantine-border-animate/styles.layer.css';
```

## Usage

The `BorderAnimate` component wraps any element to add stunning animated border effects. It's perfect for creating eye-catching UI elements like cards, buttons, input fields, alerts, and more.

### Key Features

- **Multiple animation variants** - Choose from beam, gradient, glow, or pulse effects
- **Fully customizable** - Control colors, duration, size, blur, and more
- **Works with any element** - Wrap buttons, cards, inputs, or any Mantine component
- **Performance optimized** - Uses CSS animations for smooth 60fps effects
- **Controllable** - Toggle animation on/off, show/hide the border, set static angles

Simply wrap your content with `BorderAnimate` and customize it using props:

<Demo data={demos.configurator} />

## Controlled

You can control the border animation using the `show` prop.

<Demo data={demos.controlled} />

### Animated

You can also control the border animation using the `animate` prop. If `animate` is set to `true`, the border will animate continuously. If `animate` is set to `false`, the border will be static. Anyway, you can control the angle of the border animation using the `angle` prop.

## Variant

The `BorderAnimate` component supports four different animation variants, each creating a unique visual effect. Use the `variant` prop to switch between them.

<Demo data={demos.variant} />

### Beam

The **beam** variant (default) creates a glowing light that travels along the border path. The beam moves continuously around the element's perimeter, following the border radius. This is ideal for highlighting interactive elements or creating a futuristic UI feel.

Key props for beam variant:

- `size` - Controls the size of the beam (the glowing spot)
- `anchor` - Adjusts how far inward the beam follows the border path
- `duration` - Controls how fast the beam travels around the border

### Gradient

The **gradient** variant creates a rotating conic gradient effect around the border. The gradient smoothly transitions between `colorFrom` and `colorTo` while continuously rotating. This creates an elegant, hypnotic effect suitable for loading states or premium UI elements.

Key props for gradient variant:

- `duration` - Controls the rotation speed
- `blur` - Adds a soft glow effect to the gradient

### Glow

The **glow** variant produces a pulsating glow effect that fades in and out. The entire border area illuminates with a soft, diffused light that pulses rhythmically. This is perfect for attention-grabbing elements or notification indicators.

Key props for glow variant:

- `duration` - Controls the pulse speed
- `blur` - Adjusts the softness of the glow
- `opacity` - Controls the maximum opacity of the glow

### Pulse

The **pulse** variant creates a subtle scaling animation combined with opacity changes. The border gently expands and fades, creating a breathing effect. This variant is excellent for subtle emphasis without being too distracting.

Key props for pulse variant:

- `duration` - Controls the pulse rhythm
- `blur` - Softens the border effect

## Mask and Background Effects

The `withMask` and `zIndex` props allow you to create advanced visual effects, including background glows and layered animations.

### withMask

By default, `withMask` is `true`, which clips the animated effect to the border area only. Set `withMask={false}` to let the glow extend beyond the border, creating a softer, more diffused effect.

<Demo data={demos.withMask} />

### zIndex

The `zIndex` prop controls the stacking order of the border effect. By default, the border appears in front of the content (`zIndex={1}`). Set `zIndex={-1}` combined with `withMask={false}` to create beautiful background glow effects that appear behind your content.

<Demo data={demos.withZIndex} />

### anchor

The `anchor` prop controls how far inward the beam follows the border path. By default, `anchor={0}` makes the beam follow the outer edge. Positive values move the beam path inward, which is especially useful when combined with `withMask={false}` to create inner glow effects that illuminate the content area.

## Use Cases

BorderAnimate can be used with virtually any Mantine component. Here are some common use cases to inspire your implementations.

### Buttons

Add animated borders to buttons to make them stand out. Perfect for call-to-action buttons, submit buttons, or any interactive element that needs extra attention.

<Demo data={demos.withButton} />

### Input Fields

Highlight input fields with animated borders to guide users through forms or indicate active/focused states.

<Demo data={demos.withInput} />

### Alerts and Notifications

Make alerts more noticeable with animated borders. Use different variants and colors to convey urgency levels.

<Demo data={demos.withAlert} />

### Cards

Create premium-looking cards with animated borders. Great for featured content, pricing cards, or special offers.

<Demo data={demos.withCard} />

### Chips and Badges

Even small elements like chips can benefit from animated borders to indicate selection or special status.

<Demo data={demos.withChip} />

### Accordion

Wrap accordion components with animated borders to create visually engaging expandable sections. The border effect adds a modern touch to FAQ sections or collapsible content areas.

<Demo data={demos.withAccordion} />

### Multiple Borders

Nest multiple `BorderAnimate` components to create complex, layered effects. Combine different variants, speeds, directions, and colors to achieve unique visual compositions. This technique is perfect for hero sections or premium UI elements that need extra visual impact.
